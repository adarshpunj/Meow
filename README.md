# Meow
A simple, offline Android app that contain alphabets, numbers, animal pictures, their names and sounds. A lot of code and data involved in the app was actually written and accumulated by this üëâüèª [Python script](https://github.com/adarshpunj/Meow/blob/master/media.py)!

#### About:
This app is inspired by one of the Google's toys that you can find by simply searching for 'Animal sounds'.
I scrapped off the audio and image files from the webpage using python, and placed them in an Android app for a kid.

Later on I made the use of Siri's voice and recorded the pronounciation of alphabets and numbers (also using python).
